# Unity Tooltips
A Unity3D 4.6UI tooltip system by Rotary Design

# How To Use
Just import these files into /Assets/Plugins/RotaryDesign/Tooltips and open the demo scene for a reference on how to set them up. I'll add more docs later on how to set the system up in another scene.

To use tooltips at the moment, that Match value must be set to the left side (width). I'll fix it soon.
